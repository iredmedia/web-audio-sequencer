# web-audio-sequencer

A simple collection of tools that are often required when building a digital audio workstation (DAW), ie sequencers, samplers, filters, etc. I'd like to build a very modular system, so eventually I will decouple and refactor the modules.

The best place to start is src/files/js/RedAudio.js. 

To do:
  - Modules
    - Add/Upload sample/instrument
    - Oscillators 
    - Effects
      - Filters
      - Compressors
    - Reverb
    - Delay
  - Refactoring
    - RequireJS
    - CoffeeScript
